<h1 align="center">R Package: NBA Player Stats :basketball:</h1>

<h3 align="center"><i>Ozan Adiguzel</i></h3>

## Background :microscope:

I have been scraping data for my projects from the following websites:

:arrow_right: [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)  
:arrow_right: [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/)  
:arrow_right: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)  

This is a package to extend and store the functions I have been working on. 

## Goal :dart:

The goal of this package is:

:pushpin: to get total career stats for a given player  
:pushpin: to get career stats per game for a given player  
:pushpin: to get tatal stats for a given player for a given season  
:pushpin: to get stats per game for a given player for a given season  
:pushpin: to graph total career stats for a given player over time    
:pushpin: to graph career stats per game for a given player over time   
:pushpin: to compare multiple player performances with table and graphs   
:pushpin: ...

## Main Components :wrench:

This package will include the following main components:

:white_check_mark: Web scraping: rvest  
:white_check_mark: Text Mining: stringr  
:white_check_mark: Data Cleaning: dplyr  
:white_check_mark: Visualization: ggplot2  

## Challenge :punch:

Efficiency is always a big challenge in web scraping projects. In this specific case, the above-mentioned websites store a myriad of player stats using abbreviations. To make this package more user-friendly, all components must be particularly neat and clear, a process which would be catalyzed by creating separate and detailed functions for distinct stats. 

Please take a look at the [Kevin Durant's Basketball Reference page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html) to have an idea.

## Further Development :rocket:

This project leaves much room for improvement. There are plenty of player stats available online, which would allow this package to grow exponentially.
