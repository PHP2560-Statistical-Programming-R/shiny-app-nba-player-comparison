<h4 align="center"><i>Shiny applications to facilitate the access to basketball statistics as well as player comparison</i></h4>

## Introduction

“NBA Player Comparison” is to be used by coaches, players statisticians and basketball fans alike, as it aims to improve the process of comparing player stats. Using publicly available data from “Basketball Reference”, the app displays player stats side by side for any given season allowing for easy comparison.

## Functionality 

Users should choose a season from the drop down menu. This will narrow down the list of players available for selection by the season specified. Players one and two should then be selected from their individual drop-down menus. Each time users change their player selections, they must click “compare” to update the comparison.  Along with the players’ pictures, their stats will appear on the screen. For more detail, users can choose between per game stats and totals, which are located on different tabs.
